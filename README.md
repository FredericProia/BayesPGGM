# BayesPGGM
Adjust a partial Gaussian graphical model (PGGM) following the Bayesian approach of the paper "A Bayesian approach for partial Gaussian graphical models with sparsity" (E. Okome Obiang, P. Jézéquel, F. Proïa), 2022. The Gibbs samplers for sparse, group-sparse and sparse-group-sparse direct links are provided in "GibbsPGGM.R". An example on simulated data is given in "Example.R". The real dataset Hopx (cf. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000737" target="_blank">Petretto et al. (2010)</a>) is also given and treated in "ExampleHopx.R".
