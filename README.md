# BayesPGGM
Adjust a partial Gaussian graphical model (PGGM) following the Bayesian approach of <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/advance-publication/A-Bayesian-Approach-for-Partial-Gaussian-Graphical-Models-With-Sparsity/10.1214/22-BA1315.full" target="_blank">Okome Obiang et al. (2022)</a>. The Gibbs samplers for sparse, group-sparse and sparse-group-sparse direct links are provided in "GibbsPGGM.R". An example on simulated data is given in "Example.R". The real dataset Hopx (cf. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000737" target="_blank">Petretto et al. (2010)</a>) is also given with a demonstration in "ExampleHopx.R".
